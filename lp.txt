"A Little Princess," by the author of the beloved "Secret Garden," 
Frances Hodgson Burnett. 
"What would have happened if she had not hidden it just then, 
and if she had chanced to look up at the skylight at the wrong moment, 
I do not know-perhaps the end of this chapter might have been quite different."
